An implementation of the grouping function documented in the {itertools} {Python} module.
The function is dubbed _chunkify_ here.

== Getting Started

The steps below will create an environment for building the project.
These steps assume you are on {Fedora} and familiar with the Linux command-line and {Git}.

. Clone the project's repository from GitHub.
+
[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/jwillikers/chunkify.git
----

. Change into the project's directory.
+
[source,sh]
----
cd chunkify
----

. Install the necessary development dependencies.
+
DNF::
+
[source,sh]
----
sudo dnf -y install black pre-commit pylint python3-mypy python3-pytest
----

Pipenv::
+
.. Install {Pipenv}.
+
[source,sh]
----
sudo dnf -y install pipenv
----

.. Install the Pipenv virtual environment.
+
[source,sh]
----
pipenv install --dev
----

.. Now prefix any Python commands with `pipenv run` when running them from the command-line or activate the environment with `pipenv shell`.

. Install the pre-commit hooks for the project.

=== Lint

Check the project for common programming errors with {Pylint}.

[source,sh]
----
pylint -j 0 *.py
----

=== Check Static Typing

Check static typing with {mypy}.

[source,sh]
----
mypy *.py
----

=== Test

Test cases are available for _chunkify_.
Execute them with {pytest}.

. From the root directory of the project, run `pytest`.
